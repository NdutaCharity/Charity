# Aliens in America Dataset by America Dataset Ian Klosowicz
      For this project, you play a role as a newly hired Data Analyst for a pharmaceutical company.

      It's the year 2022 and aliens are well known to be living amongst us.

      Unfortunately, some of the aliens are a bit... too alien... and would like to fit into society a bit more.

      So it's up to you to find the best state(s) we should market our new prescription.

      It would be helpful to know...

      If these aliens are hostile
      Their diet
      Their age
      It's up to you to clean up the data and report back

   ## Reporting
            How the alien population fits with the rest of the population was examined. 
            The best state to market our pharmaceuticals would be in Texas. 
            However, the administration of the prescription should be done with regard to occupation so as not to paralyze operations.
